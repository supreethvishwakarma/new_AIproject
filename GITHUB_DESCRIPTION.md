### LinkedIn Post
```
I'm excited to share my latest project: an AI-powered algorithmic trading system 
for Indian equity derivatives (NIFTY/BANKNIFTY options).

The system combines:
🧠 Dual-model ML architecture (macro + microstructure)
📊 Institutional options flow analysis
🎯 Market regime detection
⚡ Automated execution via Angel One SmartAPI

Built entirely in Python with TimescaleDB for time-series data and XGBoost 
for predictions. The system processes tick-level and minute-level data to 
generate high-probability intraday trades.

Key highlights:
• 6 months of 1-minute candle training data
• 5 days of tick data for microstructure analysis
• 18 technical indicators + order flow features
• Walk-forward validation to prevent overfitting
• Robust risk management (1% per trade, 5% daily cap)

The entire codebase is now open-source on GitHub. Whether you're a quant 
developer, algo trader, or just curious about ML in finance, check it out!

Title: [Open Source] AI-Powered Options Trading System for NSE F&O (Python)

I've been working on an algorithmic trading system for Indian options markets 
and decided to open-source it. Here's what it does:

**Architecture:**
- Dual ML models: Macro (1m candles) + Micro (tick data)
- Options flow detection (Long Build Up, Short Covering, etc.)
- Market regime detection (Trending/Sideways/High Vol)
- 3 core strategies: VWAP Momentum, Bearish Momentum, Mean Reversion

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.13
- TimescaleDB for time-series data
- XGBoost for ML
- TrueData API for market data
- Angel One SmartAPI for execution

**Risk Management:**
- 1% risk per trade
- Max 5 trades/day
- 5% daily loss cap
- ATR-based stops

The system is production-ready with 5 operating modes (mock, ingest, train, 
backtest, live). Full documentation included.

GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or implementation!

## FAQ Section for README

Consider adding this to your README:

```markdown
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this with other brokers besides Angel One?**
A: The broker adapter is modular. You can implement adapters for other brokers 
by extending the `BrokerAdapter` class.

**Q: What's the minimum capital required?**
A: Recommended minimum is ₹50,000. With 1% risk per trade, you'll risk ₹500 
per trade. Options premiums typically range from ₹50-500.

**Q: How long does model training take?**
A: On a modern laptop, training both models takes 5-10 minutes with 6 months 
of data.

**Q: Can I add more symbols?**
A: Yes! Edit `SYMBOLS` in `config/settings.py`. The system supports any NSE 
F&O instrument.

**Q: What's the expected win rate?**
A: Depends on market conditions and model quality. Aim for 45-55% win rate 
with 2:1 reward-risk ratio.

**Q: Do I need a GPU?**
A: No. XGBoost runs efficiently on CPU. Training is fast enough without GPU.

**Q: How do I update the models?**
A: Run `python main.py train` periodically (weekly/monthly) to retrain with 
fresh data.

**Q: What about slippage and commissions?**
A: The backtest engine doesn't account for slippage/commissions yet. Add ~₹40 
per trade for realistic estimates.
