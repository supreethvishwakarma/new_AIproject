```
OHLC candles
tick data
trade logs
model training data
```

---

# 7. Feature Engineering Layer

Indicators computed:

### Price indicators

```
RSI
MACD
EMA 20
EMA 50
VWAP
Bollinger bands
ATR
```

---

### Volume signals

```
relative volume
volume spikes
VWAP volume
```

---

```
open interest
OI change
PCR
implied volatility
ATM premium momentum
```

---

### Market context

```
India VIX
NIFTY trend
BANKNIFTY trend
global indices
```

---

# 8. Market Regime Detection

Purpose:

Detect market environment.

Possible regimes:

```
TRENDING BULL
TRENDING BEAR
SIDEWAYS
HIGH VOLATILITY
LOW VOLATILITY
```

Model types:

```
RandomForest
Hidden Markov Model
Gradient Boosting
```

Output example:

```
10:15 AM → TRENDING BULL
```

Strategy selection adapts to regime.

---

# 9. Strategy Engine

Strategies implemented:

## VWAP Momentum Breakout

Entry conditions:

```
price > VWAP
RSI > 55
volume spike
EMA20 > EMA50
```

Trade:

```
Buy ATM Call
```

---

## Bearish Momentum

Entry:

```
price < VWAP
RSI < 45
EMA20 < EMA50
volume spike
```

Trade:

```
Buy ATM Put
```

---

## Mean Reversion

Entry:

```
RSI extreme
price far from VWAP
Bollinger band touch
```

---

# 10. Options Flow Detector

Detects institutional positioning.

Inputs:

```
option chain data
OI change
volume spikes
strike concentration
```

Key signals:

### Long Build Up

```
price ↑
OI ↑
```

Bullish signal.

---

### Short Covering

```
price ↑
OI ↓
```

Often strong rallies.

---

### Long Unwinding

```
price ↓
OI ↓
```

Weak market.

---

### Gamma Pinning

When large OI exists near a strike.

Price gravitates toward that level.

Example:

```
NIFTY 22500 strike
large OI
```

---

# 11. Machine Learning Layer

Purpose:

Filter signals.

ML does NOT generate trades.

It evaluates probability.

Model types:

```
XGBoost
LightGBM
RandomForest
```

Target label example:

```
Did price move +0.5% in next 10 minutes?
```

Model output:

```
P(success)
```

Example:

```
0.67 probability
```

---

# 12. Trade Scoring System

Final trade score:

```
Trade Score =
0.5 * ML probability
+ 0.3 * options flow score
+ 0.2 * technical strength
```

Top ranked trades selected.

---

# 13. Trade Ranking Engine

Every scan cycle:

```
Scan market
Generate signals
Score trades
Select top 3
```

Example output:

```
1. NIFTY 22500 CE
score 0.71

2. BANKNIFTY 47000 PE
score 0.69

3. ICICI BANK CALL
score 0.63
```

---

# 14. Risk Management System

Rules:

```
risk per trade = 1%
max trades/day = 5
max daily loss = 5%
```

Position sizing example:

```
account = ₹50,000
risk per trade = ₹500
```

---

# 15. Order Execution System

Order flow:

```
signal detected
↓
risk validated
↓
place entry order
↓
place stop loss
↓
place target
```

Stop loss should be **exchange managed**.

Example:

```
Entry = 200
Stop = 180
Target = 230
```

---

# 16. Latency Expectations

Typical system latency:

| Stage | Time |
| --- | --- |
| feature calculation | 10 ms |
| ML inference | 2 ms |
| decision logic | 1 ms |
| broker order | 200–500 ms |

Total:

```
~300 ms
```

Suitable for intraday trading.

---

# 17. System Loop

    fetch market data
    update indicators
    detect market regime
    generate signals
    compute options flow
    run ML model
    rank trades
    execute trades
```

Cycle time:

```
30–60 seconds
```

---

# 18. Machine Learning Training Pipeline

↓
feature generation
↓
label creation
↓
model training
↓
model validation
↓
deploy model
```

```

---

# 19. Expected Performance

Typical realistic metrics:

| Metric | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| win rate | 55–65% |
| profit factor | 1.4–1.8 |
| max drawdown | 5–12% |

Anything higher in backtests likely indicates overfitting.
